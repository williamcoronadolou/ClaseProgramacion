This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Selection of data frame elements
```{r}
name <- c("Mercury","Venus","Earth","Mars","Jupiter","Saturn","Uranus","Neptune")
type <- c("Terrestrial planet","Terrestrial planet","Terrestrial planet","Terrestrial planet","Gas giant","Gas giant","Gas giant","Gas giant")
diameter <- c(0.382, 0.949, 1, 0.532, 11.209, 9.449, 4.007, 3.883)
rotation <- c(58.64, -243.02, 1,1.03, 0.41, 0.43, -0.72, 0.67)
rings <- c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE,TRUE,TRUE)

planets_df <- data.frame(name, type, diameter, rotation, rings)


planets_df
planets_df[1,3]
planets_df[4,]
planets_df[1:5,]
planets_df[1:5, c("rotation", "type")]

rings_vector <-planets_df$rings
rings_vector

planets_df[rings_vector,]

subset(planets_df, subset = diameter <1)

```
Sorting
```{r}
a <- c(100, 10, 1000)
order(a)
b <- a[order(a)]
b

positions <- order(planets_df$diameter)
positions
planets_df[positions,]
```

Lists
```{r}
my_vector <- 1:10
my_matrix <- matrix(1:9, ncol=3)
my_df <- planets_df[1:4,]

my_list <- list(my_vector, my_matrix, my_df)
my_list

```
Creating a named list
```{r}
names(my_list) <- c("vector","matrix","data frame")
my_list

```
Selecting elements from a list

```{r}
my_list[[3]][4]
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
